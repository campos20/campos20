### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m full cycle developer.
- I'm also a full cycle developer for this wonderful open source project, [World Cube Association](https://github.com/thewca/) (WCA).
- And a former Math professor.

These are my main technologies
- *Spring Boot (Java)*
- *React (Javascript/Typescript)*
- *Node*
- *Python*
- *AWS*
- *Terraform*

  I also worked with other technologies in the past.

# World Cube Association
My work at WCA is open source and you can see it.
- *Statistics*: The [Statistics Project]([url](http://statistics.worldcubeassociation.org/)) is the project I liked most working on. The overall process was very pleasant, yet challenging. Statistics is a spin-off of the [main website]([url](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/)) (which is in Ruby) and it uses a lot of modern technologies: Spring Boot (Java), React (Typescript), AWS (ECS, Fargate, CodeDeploy, Lambda, Batch, Api Gateway), Python. I had a lot of freedom to work on that, its main purpose is to gather and pre calculate interesting data over the WCA's database.
- *React*: I'm the main responsible for [TNoodle's](https://github.com/thewca/tnoodle) user interface. TNoodle is used for generating scrambles for official Rubik's Cube competition (and similar puzzles) across the globe. You can see a live preview [here](https://tnoodle-web.herokuapp.com/scramble). I deployed this to Heroku so people could try without building or running a jar locally, but this version should not be used in production.
- *Kotlin*: I have some contributions the server side of TNoodle (most notably to the PDF and zip generation). Almost everything else regarding TNoodle's server portion was developed by [Gregor](https://github.com/suushiemaniac).
- *Spring*: There's a batch (cron job) to check that [WCA's database is healthy](https://github.com/thewca/db-sanity-check/) and neat. It is deployed to AWS and email people that can handle the inconsistencies.

# Personal projects

Most of my projects are also cubing related.
* [FMC Ranks](https://campos20.github.io/fmc-ranks/#/) is a React project to optimize a hobby I share with some friends. It can compute ranking, generate scrambles for FMC and images. 
* [Scramble Web API](https://github.com/campos20/scramble-web-api) exposes the [tnoodle-lib](https://github.com/thewca/tnoodle-lib) over the web using React. It was developed to serve the already mentioned FMC Ranks (but is also used in some other places built by other people like [this one](https://fewestmoves.herokuapp.com/dashboard/actual), envisioned by [Guido](https://github.com/GuidoDipietro)).
* Another React project, at least this is not cubing related. It [generates random choices ](https://github.com/campos20/mega-sena-gerador)for large Brazilian lottery attempts.

# Teaching
I used to teach Mathematics and IT related chairs. Usually, I Calculus, Geometry, Statistics and Physics. Also, some Java, web technologies and basic programming lectures (UNIUBE, PitÃ¡goras, and UFU).
